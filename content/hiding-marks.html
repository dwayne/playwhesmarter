        <p>Find out which marks haven't played in a long time. We call these marks <strong>hiding marks</strong>. And, we say that they are <strong>hidden</strong>.</p>

        <p>Hiding marks have a high chance of playing in the next draw, so run them down.</p>

        <h3>How to find hiding marks?</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Firstly, sort all the Play Whe results for the last month or two by descending order of date (i.e. most recent date first).</li>
          <li>Write them down on a piece of paper.</li>
          <li>Go through the list from top to bottom taking note of ONLY the first time you see a given mark in the list. That's the last time the mark played.</li>
          <li>Repeat the previous step for every mark. Since there are 36 marks you've got to do it 36 times.</li>
          <li>Finally, the last mark you find is the mark that hasn't played in the longest time. That's your TOP hiding mark and a mark you should probably run down.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>We're here to help</h3>

        <p>Whew! That's a lot of work to do to find hiding marks. Thankfully, we're here to help. We've done all that hard work for you.</p>

        <p>The <a href="#hiding-marks">tables below</a> list the last time each mark has played. The tables are broken down into "Top 5 Hiding Marks", "Next 5 Hiding Marks" and "The Rest". Each table is sorted by descending order of date, i.e. the top mark hasn't played in the longest time.

        <h3>Our recommendation</h3>

        <p>We consider the top 5 to 10 marks to be legitimate hiding marks. Our recommendation is to pick a couple of them and run them down since they have a high chance of coming in the next draw.</p>
